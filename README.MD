# 🎮 Senakee

**Senakee** is a customized version of the classic Snake Game.  
The base was built by following a tutorial from **CodeNinja** on YouTube, but I extended it with new features and styling to make it unique.

## ✨ Features
- Pause and resume functionality  
- Multiple levels (1 to 3) with increasing difficulty  
- Background changes for each level  
- Snake color customization  
- Clean, responsive design  

## 📸 Screenshots
(Add screenshots of your game here – e.g., menu, gameplay, different levels.)

## 🚀 Demo
[Play Senakee Online](#)  
(Replace `#` with your GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel link if you deploy it.)

## 🕹️ How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to control the snake  
- Eat the food to grow longer  
- Avoid colliding with the walls or yourself  
- Progress through levels as your score increases  

## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned
While building and customizing **Senakee**, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Core JavaScript for game logic  
- Event listeners and keyboard controls  
- Working with HTML5 canvas for rendering  
- Adding game states (pause, levels, difficulty)  
- Organizing and modifying existing codebases  

## ⚡ Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadalkass/senakee.git
Open index.html in your browser to start the game.
